# The old Razor Microkernel

This repository contains old, unmaintained code and is only here for
historical reasons. The new, completely rewritten and maintained version of
this code base can be found in the
[razor-el-mk](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-el-mk) repository. The
server code now lives [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server).

Note that you should not file any issues in this project as they will not
be looked at. For the current code base
[razor-el-mk](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-el-mk), please file
bugs in [JIRA](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/RAZOR). This code is
not maintained any longer.
